Abstract:

All pharmaceutical products, including vaccines, can increase the risk of some undesired medical occurances (adverse events). Evaluating these risks post-licensure is essential for evaluating the safety of vaccines, since rare adverse events might go undetected in pre-licensure studies. This thesis introduces the BmaxSPRT method for vaccine safety surveillance, suitable for monitoring the safety of vaccines in real-time, utilizing electronic health care records. 

Vaccine safety surveillance (VSU) can be used to study a suspected, biologically plausible causal relationships between a vaccine and an adverse event. Information regarding such relationships are called safety signals. VSU methods considered in this thesis address specified hypothesis about suspected vaccine-event pairs and therefore belong to the refinement stage of drug safety studies.

VSU can be seen as an observational study for which different study designs could be used. Popularity of vaccination, self-selection and changes in diagnosis coding practises, along with other possible sources of bias present challeges for popular cohort designs. Self-controlled study designs such as the self-controlled case series (SCCS), eliminate time-invariant confounders and are therefore often more suitable for evaluating vaccine risks. This thesis introduces both a simple and a more general version of SCCS and explicitly describes the assumptions related to the method.

A VSU method involves a decision rule for generating safety signals. Natural goals of a VSU method are to control the rates of false positive and false negative signals, as well as generate a signal as soon as possible when an association between the vaccine and the adverse event exists. Statistical hypothesis testing can be used to derive the decision rules. Since observations arrive sequentially with the object of minimizing the expected sample size, methods designed for sequential analysis should be used.  

This thesis describes the maxSPRT, a sequential hypothesis testing method designed for vaccine safety surveillance. The thesis then introduces in detail the BmaxSPRT, a variant of maxSPRT based on a self-controlled study design such as the SCCS. The derivation of the decision rules for BmaxSPRT, including the computation of the critical values, is described in detail both mathematically and algorithmically. 

The BmaxSPRT addresses hypotheses concerning the relative incidence of adverse events during specified risk and control periods. The sensitivity of the method to these choices is studied in this thesis. The analysis highlights the importance of careful consideration of the risk and control periods by quantifying the loss of power due to poor choices.

As a proof-of-concept, the BmaxSPRT method was retrospectively applied to Finnish register data. The relationship between the incidence of febrile seizures and three childhood vaccines; Measles-Mumps-Rubella- (MMR), Pneumococcal- (PCV) and the Rota virus vaccination (Rota) was studied. The BmaxSPRT generated an expected safety signal related to MMR and concluded that the relative incidence of febrile seizures is higher during a period 0-13 days following vaccination compared to a period 14-41 days following vaccination. The experiment also highlighted the need for more in depth analysis regarding PCV and febrile seizures.
