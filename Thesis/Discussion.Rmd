# Conclusions  

All pharmaceutical products, including vaccines, can increase the risk of some undesired medical occurances (adverse events). Evaluating these risks post-licensure is essential for evaluating the safety of the vaccine, since rare adverse events might go undetected in pre-licensure studies.  

This thesis has presented vaccine safety surveillance as an observational study where the goal is to evaluate the safety of a vaccine (or vaccines) in real-time. The goal of a safety surveillance method is to generate a safety signal as soon as possible, when an association between a vaccine and an adverse event exists.  

Electronic health care data bases (registers) can be utilized as sources of data for safety surveillance. Registers such as AvoHILMO in Finland provide daily data and thus enable near real-time surveillance. Adverse events can be operationalized by one or several medical diagnoses, identified with an ICD code. 

An important consideration in vaccine safety studies is that sources of bias such as self-selection and changes in diagnosis coding practises present challenges for which some observational study designs such as the cohort design, are vulnerable to. Case-only designs such as SCCS and CCO eliminate all time invariant confounders and can therefore be considered more suitable for drug safety analysis.  

## Contribution to existing literature  

This thesis has considered vaccine safety surveillance from the general perspectives of drug safety and epidemiological studies. The type of safety surveillance considered is placed in the refiment stage of drug safety studies, where the interest is in refining a previously identified, biologically plausible causal relationship between a vaccine and an adverse event. The refinement stage is preceeded by an identification stage and possibly followed by a confirmation stage. 

A key contribution of this thesis to existing literature is to explicitly link the BmaxSPRT vaccine safety surveillance method to a specific epidemiological study design, the SCCS, therefore showing how and why the BmaxSPRT is a self-controlled method.  

More specifically, I have shown how a simple version of SCCS combined with the maximized sequential probability ratio test (maxSPRT) gives the BmaxSPRT method. Additionally I have, both mathematically and algorithmically, presented the computation of the critical values of BmaxSPRT, which are essential elements of the decision rule of BmaxSPRT, also presented in detail in this work.

I have also studied the sensitivity of BmaxSPRT to the choice of risk and control periods by simulation, showing how the power of BmaxSPRT is affected by a poor choice of risk and control periods.

## Discussion of application results

As a proof-of-concept, I applied the BmaxSPRT method retrospectively to Finnish register data to show how the method performs with real data. The outcome of interest was febrile seizures. Three vaccines, MMR, PCV and Rota, each with a different type of known or suspected relationship to febrile seizures, were the exposures of interest.

The effects of each of the vaccines were studied during a risk period of 0-13 days following vaccination. The results of the experiment were as expected for MMR and Rota, as a safety signal was generated for the former and not generated for the latter. A safety signal was also generated for PCV. 

The result of the experiment for PCV raises further questions. Utilizing all the available data, the point estimate for the rate ratio between the chosen risk and control periods stayed consistently, but not considerably, above 1, indicating some increased risk during the risk period. Given that the chosen risk period significantly differed from the suspected risk period for PCV, there are at least two plausible interpretations for this outcome: (i) The actual risk period for PCV is much longer than the suspected period, and the risk of febrile seizures increases only slightly. (ii) The actual risk period for PCV is according to the suspected risk period and the risk of febrile seizures increases substantially.  

A confirmation analysis studying the relationship between febrile seizures and PCV vaccinations should be performed.

## Further reasearch

The thesis provides starting points for further reseach in developing the BmaxSPRT method. The general version of SCCS can provide a framework for a more general version of a self-controlled maxSPRT, a multinomial maxSPRT if you will. Maximum information trials provide a promising approach for dealing with grouped observations. 

This thesis has argued that the BmaxSPRT method belongs to the refinement stage of drug safety studies and requires that a safety signal has been previously identified. However, there is no reason that vaccine safety surveillance should be limited to the refiment stage. Vaccine safety surveillance could also aim to identify safety signals. However, that would require different methods.
