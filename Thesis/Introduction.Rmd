# Introduction

## Safety surveillance

Pharmaceutical products (drugs) can have unintended side effects. An untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a drug is called an adverse event. Rare adverse events related to drugs are often impossible to detect in pre-licensure studies and therefore there is an incentive to monitor the safety of a drug post-licensure [@Kulldorff2011]. In this work, monitoring the safety of drugs is called safety surveillance. 

The information related to a possible causal relationship between a drug and an adverse event is called a safety signal (signal). Safety surveillance is interested in finding and generating these signals. According to @Nelson2015, post-licensure safety aims related to drugs can be classified into three stages:

1. **Signal identification**: Considers a large number of events and involves detecting signals related to unexpected adverse events
2. **Signal refinement**: Considers biologically plausible drug-event pairs suspected to have a causal relationship. Addresses multiple specified hypotheses related to the pairs.
3. **Signal confirmation**:  Involves a one-time, more in depth study of a previously generated signal. 

Safety surveillance can relate to stages one or two, with the aim of either finding new associations (identification) or validating the evidence of suspected associations (refinement).

An assumption to the type of safety surveillance considered in this work is that a biologically plausible exposure-event pair has been previously identified. Further, the method to be introduced assumes that the relationship between the exposure and the adverse event can be characterised by defining a time interval of possibly increased risk. This places the safety surveillance considered here to the refinement stage.  

In this thesis the drug of interest is a vaccine product (vaccine). The goal is to define and utilize a safety surveillance method to make decisions related to safety signal generation, utilizing electronic medical records.   

## Vaccine safety surveillance  

In vaccine safety surveillance the researcher or an automated system monitors the safety of vaccines. Natural goals of vaccine safety surveillance are to control the expected rate of false positive and false negative signals. It is also desirable to generate a signal as soon as possible, if an association between the vaccine and an adverse event exists. After a signal has been generated, further action can be taken, for example a confirmation analysis can be performed.

Statistical methods designed specifically for vaccine safety surveillance exist. This thesis will largely focus on the maximized sequential probability ratio test (maxSPRT), which is a statistical hypothesis testing method designed for vaccine safety surveillance [@Kulldorff2011]. Vaccine safety survaillance based on maxSPRT has been utilized between 2005 - 2015 in many countries such as in USA, UK, Taiwan and New Zealand. The main focus has been on studying the effects of influenza vaccines. [@Leite2016]

There are multiple variants of the maxSPRT method such as the Poisson maxSPRT (PmaxSPRT), binomial maxSPRT (BmaxSPRT) and conditional PmaxSPRT, along with further versions designed for handling grouped observations. According to @Leite2016, the most popular variant of maxSPRT has been PmaxSPRT followed by BmaxSPRT. In this work the major focus will be on the BmaxSPRT variant.

One situation when a safety surveillance method such as the BmaxSPRT could be applied, would be an introduction of a new vaccine to a national vaccination program, such as the introduction of chicken pox vaccination starting in 1.9.2017 in Finland. If there are previously identified safety signals (any reasons to suspect a possible causal relation between the vaccine and some rare adverse event), safety surveillance could be initialized to refine these signals, utilizing accumulating data from electronic health records.


## Elements of safety surveillance

In this work I will generally view a safety surveillance method as consisting of three elements: (1) data accumulation (2) study design and (3) decision rule for generating signals. Table \ref{tab:elements} describes options for the elements. A unique combination of the three elements can be thought to define a unique safety surveillance method. The different variants of maxSPRT can be viewed as unique safety surveillance methods which vary in terms of the underlying study design and assumptions related to data accumulation. They all use (sequential) hypothesis testing as the decision element.

For any reasonably rare adverse events, daily accumulating observations can be considered as continuous observations. In this work I will mainly consider situations where observations (electronic health care data) accumulates daily. Therefore the focus will be on continuous observations. I will present a case for utilizing case-only designs -- and specifically the self-controlled case series (SCCS) -- as the design element of a vaccine safety surveillance method. I will utilize maxSPRT sequential hypothesis testing as the decision element.  

These choices (continuous observations, a case-only design and maxSPRT) lead to the continuous binomial variant of maxSPRT, BmaxSPRT.


```{r}
element <- c("Data accumulation", "Study design", "Decision rule")
options <- c("Continuous observations, grouped observations", 
             "Case-only design, cohort design, case-control design", 
             "Hypothesis testing")
df <- data.frame(Element = element, Options = options)
knitr::kable(df, caption  = "\\label{tab:elements}Elements of Vaccine safety surveillance and options related to them.")
```


## The operationalization of exposure and outcome

The starting point of vaccine safety surveillance is the definition of one or several vaccine - adverse event pairs. In this thesis the biological condition of interest (the adverse event) is operationalized by a group of medical diagnoses related to hospital visits. The medical diagnoses are identified based on a diagnosis code recorded in an electronic medical record data base. Vaccinations are operationalized similarily from medical records, identified using the vaccines name or an identification code. 

Utilizing register data for vaccine safety research is both economical and powerful, because the data collection is practically free and the registers allow for near population level studies. However, it is important to note that registers are secondary data sources - the data are originally collected for other reasons than the research question at hand - and therefore the selection, quality and methods of the data collection are not controlled by the researcher [@Sorensen1996]. The visit to a hospital resulting in a certain diagnosis code might not directly relate to the biological condition of interest.

In Finland, medical diagnoses data are available from electronic health record data bases such as The National Hospital Discharge Register (HILMO) and The Register of Primary Health Care Visits (AvoHILMO). Vaccination data are available from the National Vaccination Register (NVR). AvoHILMO, HILMO and NVR all contain time-stamped patient-level information and the data from the registers can be linked using a personal identification code, unique to all individuals in Finland. Diagnoses and vaccinations can thus be linked on an individual level and the relative timing of vaccinations to medical diagnoses can be asserted.

There are two diagnosis classifications used in Finland: the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition (ICD-10) and to lesser extent the International Classification of Primary Care, 2nd edition (ICPC-2). The ICD-10 is much broader than the ICPC-2, but the ICPC-2 can be used alongside the ICD-10 due to cross-tabulation provided by the World Health Organisation [@icd10]. 

Data from AvoHILMO and NVR are available as daily collections and data from HILMO is available three times a year (2016). Near real-time vaccine safety surveillance considered in this thesis is a possibility in Finland, utilizing data from AvoHILMO and NVR. 

## Outline

This thesis will introduce the vaccine safety surveillance method BmaxSPRT in detail by breaking it down to it's elements. The study design and decision rules for signal generation are the main focus of this work and are given thorough treatment. The outline of the thesis is as follows.  

**Chapter 2** offers discussion related to the design elements in vaccine safety surveillance, focusing on case-only study designs.  
**Chapter 3** offers discussion related to the decision elements in vaccine safety surveillance and focuses on sequential hypothesis testing. Dealing with grouped observations (data accumulation) is briefly discussed in section 3.4.  
**Chapter 4** offers a proof of concept application of the BmaxSPRT method, utilizing three different vaccine exposures and a single outcome of interest.  

The thesis ends with conclusions and discussion.
