For the MPR group, the 2014 cohort was exluded because the expected age at vaccination is higher and no sufficient data is yet available.",
"The possible adverse events of interest are hospitalizations with icd10 diagnosis codes related to seizures. ",

"The method used is the binomial variant of maxSPRT (Kulldorff 2011).
From an epidemiological study standpoint, it is a self-controlled case-control method,
where the surveillance period for each child is divided into case and control periods.
An event occuring during the case period is classified as a case and an event occuring during the control period as a control.
The method uses only data on cases. </p>",
"<p>",
"In the binomial maxSPRT the assumption under the null hypothesis (H0) is that
the probability of an event classified as a case is proportional to the time spent in the case interval.
For example, if the case period is 7 days and the control period 14 days and the person with an event has fully passed through both intervals,
then the (H0) probability of the event classified as a case is 7 / (7 + 14) = 1/3.
The alternative hypothesis (H1) is that the probability of a case is higher, which corresponds to an added risk of an event during the risk period. </p>",
"<p>",
"The test statistic (ts) is the maximized likelihood ratio L(p|H1) / L(p|H0).
Critical values were computed numerically using the Sequential R-package.
For each day of surveillance the test statistic is calculated and compared to the critical value.
If the test statistic equals or exceeds the critical value at any point, H1 is accepted and a signal is detected. </p>",

"An estimate for the baseline incidence for each age group described above was used to compute the
expected number of events during surveillance under H0, and this was then used as the upper limit of surveillance (N).
In this experiment the incidences were calculated by summing the events during the ages of interest (excluding the risk period)
and estimating the population at risk (vaccinated) using exact population data and the estimated vaccination coverages of the chosen vaccines. </p>",
"<p>",
"The case interval was chosen to be 1 - 14 days after vaccination and the control interval 15 - 42 days after vaccination.
Choosing the control interval to be after vaccination gets around the healthy vaccinee problem,
